    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Jumbo breakfast cookies are perfect for grabbing on the way out the door.
    </p>
    <p>Feel free to substitute chocolate chips or dried cranberries for the raisins or 
        any combination of the three for a little different twist.
    </p>  
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup peanut butter</li>
        <li> 1 cup butter or margarine </li>
        <li> ½ cup water </li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons vanilla extract </li>
        <li> 2 eggs </li>
        <li> 2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li> 1 ½ cups rolled oats </li>
        <li> 1 ½ cups raisins </li>
        <li> 6 cups toasted oat cereal rings (such as Cheerios®) </li>
    </ul>  
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>In a very large bowl, mix together the sugar, peanut butter, butter, water, vanilla 
            and eggs until smooth. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; stir into the batter. 
            Mix in the oats and raisins, then carefully stir in the cereal. Drop 1/2 cupfuls of dough 
            onto ungreased cookie sheets, spacing cookies about 4 inches apart. 
            Flatten cookies to 1 inch thick.</li>
        <li>Bake for 12 minutes in the preheated oven, until cookies are lightly browned at the edges. 
            Let stand on the cookie sheets for 5 minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely. 
            Store at room temperature. I like to put each cookie into a sandwich bag which makes them easy 
            to grab on the way out the door.
